# Sprouter

A full-screen, auto-advancing social media reader for Mastodon and Bluesky. Designed to run on a display — posts cycle through one at a time with animated text and a countdown timer, pulling from all your connected accounts into a single merged feed.

## Features

- Connect Mastodon and Bluesky accounts (multiple providers supported simultaneously)
- Posts auto-advance every 8 seconds, after the word animation completes
- Animated text display with randomised GSAP templates (blockTilt, spiral, stackFlip, arc)
- Media backgrounds for image posts
- Reply context shown as a quote above the reply body
- Long URLs truncated to keep the display readable
- Pause/resume with the in-feed button
- Progress bar counts down to the next post
